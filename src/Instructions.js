        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Looklet has offices, customers and partners spread out over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping track of timezones is a continous challenge, and, of course,
          we don't want to wake our friends up unnecessarily!
        </p>
        <p>
          The objective is to create an easy to use application that show the
          sunrise and sunset in different cities across the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve this, we need to be able to select a date of the year, and
          view a list of cities and their respective sunrise and sunset times.
        </p>
        <p>The places we need to know the sunrise/sunset of are:</p>{" "}
        <ul>
          <li>Toronto, CA</li>
          <li>Texas, USA</li>
          <li>New York, USA</li>
          <li>Pennsylvania, USA</li>
          <li>California, USA</li>
          <li>Sweden</li>
          <li>Germany</li>
          <li>France</li>
          <li>Sri Lanka</li>
          <li>Vietnam</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Helpful APIs</h3>
        <p>
          There is a very helpful Sunrise/sunset service available at{" "}
          <a href="https://sunrise-sunset.org/api"> sunrise-sunset.org</a> that
          we suggest that you use. We've also added a file
          <tt>locations.json</tt> with <em>location to latitude/longlitude</em>{" "}
          mapping for your convenience.

        <h3>Submission requirements</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Anonymize Your Results</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          At Looklet, we value fairness highly.
          <br />
          When reviewing the submitted tests, we want to ensure that we are free
          from bias. To achieve this, we want the tests to be anonymized.
          <br />
          Ensure the test is anonymized (does not contain any information that
          would mean that a reviewer could easily identify you, or anything
          personal about you)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Create a .zip File through Codesandbox.io</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          To make it easier for you and for our reviewers, we ask you to, when
          you are ready to submit the result that you create a .zip file through
          codesandbox.io <br />
          To do so, put your solution in codebox.io (now is a good time to
          verify the solution one last time) and then go to{" "}
          <tt>File -> Export to zip</tt>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Do Not Share The Test nor Your Results </b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Please don't share the tests nor your results publicly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, for your convenience, this codebox has a react skeleton you
          may use. <tt>index.js</tt> contains: <br />
          <br />
          <tt>const rootElement = document.getElementById("sunRiseSetApp");</tt>
          <br />
          <tt>ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, rootElement);</tt>
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
